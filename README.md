# TrueOpenVR Drivers
Ready and samples drivers for VR devices.

## Drivers
**OpenTrackUDP** - the driver allows you to connect a lot of different trackers: Oculus Rift (DK1, DK2, CV1), Aruco paper marker (webcam + paper), FreePie UDP receiver (Android), Hatire Arduino, PointTracker, Intel RealSense, Fusion, Razer Hydra, UDP over network (custom for developers), SteamVR). In the OpenTrack settings, you need to change the "Output Interface" to "UDP over network" and the IP address to "127.0.0.1".

**Splitter** - the driver allows you to connect one driver for the VR headset, and the second driver for the controllers. You can configure the plug-in in the "Splitter.ini" file located in the "TrueOpenVR\Drivers" folder, changing the driver names.

**Sample** - is a sample driver for C++ and Delphi.

**Fake** - driver simulating a VR device.
